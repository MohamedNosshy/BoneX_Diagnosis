## 📌 Project Highlights

- 🧠 **Deep Learning Models**  
  Utilized pre-trained architectures like **MobileNet** for detecting bone diseases and fractures from X-ray images with high accuracy.

- 🧪 **Explainable AI (XAI)**  
  Integrated XAI techniques including **Grad-CAM** and **Grad-CAM++** to generate heatmaps that visually explain the AI model’s focus and predictions.

- 🌐 **Frontend Development**  
  Designed a responsive and clean UI using:
  - HTML5  
  - CSS3  
  - JavaScript  
  - Bootstrap

- ⚙️ **Backend Development**  
  Built the backend using **Flask**, connecting the deep learning models with the frontend and handling image input/output, model predictions, and report generation.

- 🖼️ **Model Deployment**  
  Connected and deployed deep learning models seamlessly within the Flask API to support real-time inference.
